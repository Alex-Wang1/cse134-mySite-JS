Personal Site:
I did not make changes to my personal site other than get rid of projects button in contact me 
page (I do not need to show projects in contact me page, it make no sense, so I delete it), since 
I am going to use this as my real personal site and I am still working on Figma and try to design 
a contact form that fit my theme. Another big part of my site is the projects site, but I do not 
have anything ideal to put in course project and side project, so I will leave it blank and update 
it later.
For 3rd party code, I am looking for it but there is nothing I consider fit my site (some of them
are fancy, but I need a lowkey one with interesting functionality to fit my site theme).
